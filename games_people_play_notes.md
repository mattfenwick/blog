# Notes on "Games People Play"

[Games People Play: the Psychology of Human Relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_People_Play_(book)), published in 1964, is a fascinating, easy to read book by Eric Berne.

## Summary

*Please note: I'm not a subject matter expert in psychology!*

This book identifies a pattern of human interactions called 'games'.

Check out [its Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_People_Play_(book)#Summary) for a more detailed summary.

### Ego state

Three ego states: child, parent, and adult.

When a person does something: it's important to know which state they're in, and it's important to know which state the people they're interacting with are in.
It might also be important to know which state they **want** to be in, and which state **others** think that person is in.

### Transaction

An interaction between two people, in which the ego state of each person is noted.  There's a stimulus and a response.

Example:  

A transaction may be complementary: 
 - stimulus: child -> parent
 - response: child <- parent
 
A transaction may be crossed:
 - stimulus: adult -> adult
 - response: child <- parent
 
Complementary transactions are smooth, whereas crossed transactions cause problems and may end a conversation.

Transactions may be simple or ulterior.
 - simple: overt and straightforward
 - ulterior: there's a hidden second level to a transaction with a second set of ego states in both participants
   - social level: overt
   - psychological level: ulterior

### Game

A series of transactions following a pattern.  Berne gives specific examples of games, explains who/what/when/where/how/why of games, and shows how games can be good or bad for the people playing them.

Games can be good when they help build relationships and reinforce positive, productive patterns of behavior.

Game can be bad when they're pathological, undermine relationships, and destroy people.


## In practice

### Ego state

**Make sure to activate the appropriate ego state depending on the context.**

For example:

| Ego state | Appropriate situations to use |
|-|-|
| Adult | Negotiating, communicating, getting work done |
| Child | Brainstorming, new opportunities |
| Parent | Onboarding new team members |

**Pay attention to the ego state of other people.**  Knowing this may help to understand why a person is behaving a certain way, or help predict what a person will do.

### Transaction

**Make sure that transactions are complementary.**  If not, stop, figure out why not and fix the situation.

**Watch out for ulterior transactions.**  These aren't inherently bad, but misidentifying or failing to recognize them may be.

Examples of crossed transactions (Person A, Person B):
 - "adult -> adult", then "child <- parent"
   - A wants to work with B to solve a problem
   - B wants to simply tell A what to do
 - "child -> parent", then "adult <- adult"
   - A wants nurturing from B
   - B receives tactical instructions from A
 - "adult -> adult", then "parent <- child"
   - A wants to work with B to solve a problem
   - B elevates minor roadblocks to show stoppers


### Game

TODO

Games can be serious!  Watch out for:
 - avoid using games to diagnose and write-off or judge other people; i.e. use it for practical/concrete benefits to get better results from situations, but don't use it as justification to dislike or disregard somebody or to reinforce biases
 - people don't like having their games explicitly identified or interrupted.  If you do either of these -- tread lightly!

## Conclusion: why should you care about this book?

This book **does** seem to be directly applicable to real-world situations I've been in.
I think it's possible to leverage the knowledge from this book to identify negative patterns of interaction and behavior to get better results in difficult situations.

Specifically:

 - identify patterns in your interactions: learn to stop the bad patterns and reinforce the good patterns of behavior
 - identify patterns in other's behavior: understand what they're doing and why, avoid getting sucked into negative patterns of behavior
